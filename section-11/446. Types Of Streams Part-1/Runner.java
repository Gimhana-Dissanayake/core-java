// In java, all streams are provided in the form of predefined classes in a
// seperate package like "java.io"

// In java, all the streams are divided into the following two types.

// 1. Byte Oriented Streams
// 2. Character Oriented Streams

// 1. Byte Oriented Streams
// -----------------------------

// These streams are able to allow data in the form of bytes[bits] in continous
// flow from input devices to Java application and from Java application to
// Output devices.

// There are two types of Byte Oriented streams.

// 1. InputStream
// 2. OutputStream

// 1. InputStream: These streams are able to allow data in the form of bytes in
// continous flow from input devices to Java application

// Ex:
// InputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream,
// DataInputStream, ObjectInputStream

// 2. OutputStream: These streams are able to allow data in the form of bytes in
// continous flow from java applications to Output Devices.
// Ex: OutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, FileOutputStream,
// BufferedOutputStream, DataOutputStream, ObjectOutputStream.
