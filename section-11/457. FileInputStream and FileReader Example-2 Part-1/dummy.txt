Butterflies are insects with colorful, delicate wings and a distinctive, fluttering flight pattern. They undergo a complete metamorphosis, changing from a caterpillar to a pupa and finally to an adult butterfly. Butterflies play an important role in pollination and serve as a food source for other animals. There are over 20,000 species of butterflies found all over the world.
