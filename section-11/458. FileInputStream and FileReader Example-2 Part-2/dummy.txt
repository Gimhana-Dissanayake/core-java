utterflies are insects with colorful wings and slender bodies. They undergo a metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a chrysalis and finally emerge as a beautiful flying insect. They play important roles in pollination and serve as food for other species. There are over 20,000 species of butterflies found all over the world, each with unique markings and patterns on their wings.
