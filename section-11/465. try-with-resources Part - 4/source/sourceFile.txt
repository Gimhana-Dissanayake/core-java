Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are designed to think and act like humans. These systems are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions. AI has become an integral part of our daily lives, influencing various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. AI technologies include machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. While AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, there are also concerns about its impact on employment and privacy. It is important to continue researching and developing ethical AI practices to ensure its safe and beneficial use.
