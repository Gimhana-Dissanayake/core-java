// Initially, there are two models to execute applications.
// 1. Single process mechanism / Single Tasking
// 2. Multi process mechanism / Multi Tasking
public class Runner {

}

// 1. Single process mechanism / Single Tasking
// ----> This model allows only one process to execute the complete application.
// ----> It follows sequenctial execution of the task.
// ----> It will increase application execution time, so it reduce application
// performance.

// 2. Multi process mechanism / Multi Tasking
