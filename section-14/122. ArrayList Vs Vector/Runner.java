// Ans
// 1. ArrayList was introduced in JDK1.2 version.
// Vector was introuduced in JDK1.0 version.
// 2. ArrayList is not legacy Collection.
// Vector is legacy collection.
// 3. ArrayList has the incremental capacity value,
// NewCapacity = (CurrentCapacity * 3/2) + 1;
// Vector has incremental Capacity value,
// NewCapcity = 2 * CurrentCapacity
// 4. In case of ArrayLIst we are unable to provide our own incremental capacity value. In case of vector, we are able to provide our own incremental capacity value.
// 5. In case of ArrayList, we are unable to get capacity value explicitly, because, no capacity() method is existed in ArrayList.
// In case of vector, we are able to get capacity value explicitly, because, there is capacity() mehtod in vector.
// 6. ArrayList is not synchronized collection.
// Vector is Synchronized Collection.
// 7. In ArrayList class, no method  in synchronized method.
// 8. ArrayList allows more than one thread at a time to access data. Vector allows only one Thread at a time to access data.
// 9. ArrayList follows parallel exectution of the threads.
// Vector follows sequencial execution of the threads.
// 10. ArrayList will readuce application execution time.
// Vector will increate application execution time.
// 11. ArrayList is able to increase application performance.
// Vector is able to reduce application preformance
// 12. ArrayList is not giving guarantee for data consistancy.
// Vector is giving guarantee for data consitancy.
// 13. Arraylist is not a threadsafe resource.
// Vector is threadsafe resource
