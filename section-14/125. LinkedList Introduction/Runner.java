public class Runner {}
// It was introduced in JDK1.2 version.
// It is not legacy colleciton.

// It is index based, it able to arrange all the elements as per indexing

// It follows insertion order
// It does not following sorting order
// It allows heterogenous elements
// It allows more than one null element
// It has "Double LinkedList" as an internal data structure
// It is suggestible for the frequent insertion and deletions
// It is not synchronized Collection.
// It does not have synchronized methods.
// It allows more thant one thread at a time to access data
// It fallows parallel execution of the threads.
// It reduces application execution time.
// It improved application perfromance
// It does not give gurantee for data consistancy
// It is not a threadsafe resource
