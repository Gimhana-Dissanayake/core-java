// It was provided by JAVA in its JDK1.5 version.
// It is not legacy collection.
// It is a direct implementation class to Queue interface.
// It able to manage all the elements prior to processing as per priorities, but, windows operating system does not support priority based operations.

// It is not index based.
// It allows duplicate elements.
// It does not follow insertion order.
// It follows sorting order when priorities are not defined and it able to provide its own ordering when priorityQueue are not supported.
// It allows only homogeneous elements, it does not allow heterogenous elements, if we add any heterogeneous element then JVM will raise an exception like java.lang.ClassCastException.
// It does not allow null element, if we add any null element then JVM will raise an exception like java.lang.NullPointerException.
// It allows only comparable elements, if we add any non comparable element then JVM will raise an exception like java.lang.ClassCastException, if we want ot add non comparable elmeents then we must use 'java.util.Comparator'.

// Its initial capacity is 11 elements.
// It is not synchronized Collection.
// No method is synchronized in PriorityQueue.
// It allows more than one thread at a time to access data.
// It follows parallel execution.
// It reduces application execution time.
// It improve application performance.
// It does not give guarantee for data consistancy.
// It is not threadsafe.
