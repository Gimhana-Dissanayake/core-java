// Map:

// It was introduced by Java in its JDK1.2 version.
// Map is not child interface to Collection, Map is one of the root interface in Collection Framework.
// It is able to represent all the element in the form of key-value pairs.

// Ex: To represent technology directory, where data like phone number and customer name are represented in the form of key-value pairs there we will use Maps.

// Ex: to represent Students attendance register we will use Maps, because, in students attendence register data like student roll number and student name represent  in the form of key-value pairs.

// In Maps, both keys and values are objects, key and values are not primitives data types, atleast, wrapper classes objects.
// It key-value pairs, keys must be unique, they must not allow duplicates,but, values may be duplicated.
// In maps, by default, both insertion order and sorting order are not followed.
// NOTE: Following insertion order or sorting order is varied from one implementation class to another implementation class.
// EX: HashMap is not following both insertion order and sorting order.
// EX: LinkedHashMap is able to follow insertion order.
// EX: SortedMap, NavigableMap, TreeMap are able to follow sorting order.
// In Maps, bydefault, Heterogenous elements are allowed.
// Note: SortedMap, NaviagleMap and TreeMap are able to allow only Homogenous elements at keys side.
// In maps, by default, keys are able to allow only one null element, because, keys are not allowing duplicates, but values are able to allow any no of null elements.
// Note: SortedMap, NavigableMap, TreeMap are not allowing even single null element at keys
