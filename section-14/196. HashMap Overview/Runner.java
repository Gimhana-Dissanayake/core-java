// HashMap:
// It was introduced by Java in its JDK1.2 version.
// It is not Legacy Map.
// It is a direct implementation class to Map interface.

// It allows all the elements in the form of Key-Value pairs.
// In Key-Value pairs, both keys and values are objects.
// In Key-Value pairs, keys must be unique, keys must not allow duplicate elements, but values may be duplicated.
// HashMap does not follow insertion order.
// HashMap does not follow sorting order.
// In Key-Value pairs, both keys and values are able to allow heterogeneous elements.
// In Key-Value pairs, keys are able to allow only one null element, but values are able to allow any number of null elements.
// HashMap internal data structure is 'Hashtable'
// Its initial default capacity is '16' elements.
// Its initial default load factor is 75%.
// It is not synchronized.
// No mehtod is synchronized in HashMap.
// It allows more than one thread at a time to access data.
// It follows parallel execution of the threads.
// It reduces application execution time.
// It improved application performance.
// It does not give guarentee for data consistancy.
// So it is not a threadsafe resource
