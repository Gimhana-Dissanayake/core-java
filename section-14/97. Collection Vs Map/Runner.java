// Q. What is th difference between Collection and Map?
// Ans:
// In Java applications, to represent a group of individual object an entity
// there we will use Collection.
// Ex: If we want to represent all employee objects as single entity there we
// will use Collection object.

// In java applications, if we want to represent all object in the form of
// key-value pairs in an entity there we will use 'Map'
// Ex: Representing Customer phone number and customer name in telephone
// directory

// Ex: Representing Students Attendence with student role number and student
// name in attendace register we will use Map.
