    // Interface is a java feature[container], it able to allow 0 or more no of
    // abstract methods

    // To declare interface we wil use "interface" keyword

    // For interfaces, we are able to declare reference variables, we are unable to
    // create objects.

    // In case of interfaces, by default, all variables are "public static final",
    // no need to declare explicitly. Public means that variable is available
    // through out the application. Static means we can access that variable by
    // using the interface name, no need to create any object. finally means not
    // changing value, whatever value that was provided initially that value is
    // fixed

    // In case of interfaces, by default all methods are "public and abstract", no
    // need to declare explicitly

    // interfaces are able to provide more sharability

    // PROCEDURE TO USE INTERFACES IN JAVA APPLICATIONS:
    // 1.declare an interface by using "interface" keyword.
    // 2.declare variables and methods inside the interface as per requirment.
    // 3.declare an implementation class for the interface.
    // 4.Provide implementation for all the abstract methods which are declared in
    // interface
    // 5.In main class, in main() method, create object for implementation class and
    // declare reference variable either for interface or for implementation class.
    // 6.Access interface members

    // NOTE: If we declare reference variable for interfaces then we are able to
    // access only interface members, but, we are unable to access implmentation
    // class own memebers, but, if we declare referece variable for implementation
    // class then we are able to access both interface members and implementation
    // class own members
