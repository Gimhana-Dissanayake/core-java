//Q)What are the differences between classes, abstract classes and interfaces?
//Ans: Classes are able to allow only concreate methods.
//Abstract classes are able allow concreate methods and abstract methods.
//Interfaces are able to allow only abstract methods.

//To declare classes, we are able to use "class" keyword.
//To declare abstract classes, we will use "abstract" keyword.
//To declare interfaces, we will use "interface" keyword.

//For classes only, we are able to prepare both reference variables and objects. 
//For abstract classes and interfaces we are able to declare reference 
//variables only, we are unable to create objects

//In case of interfaces, by default, all variables are "public static final".
//In case of classes and abstract classes, no default classes exist for variables

//In case of interfaces, by default all methods are public and abstract. 
//In case of classes and abstract classes, no default cases are existed 
//for methods.

//classes are able to provide less sharablity.
//Abstract classes are able to provide middle level sharability.
//Interfaces are able to provide more sharability.

//Classes can have constructors.
//Abstract classes can have constructors.
//Interfaces cant have constructors.

//Classes are able to allow static blocks.
//Abstract classes are able to allow static block.
//Interface are not allowing static block.

//Classes are able to allow instance blocks.
//Abstract classes are able to allow instance blocks.
//Interfaces are not allowing instance blocks.
