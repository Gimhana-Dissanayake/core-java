    // Q. what is the difference between object and instance
    // Ans: Object is a memory block to store data. Instance is the copy of data or
    // layer of data existed in an object at a particular point of time

    // In a single object, we are able to get no of instances, but, all the
    // instances are existed in overridden manner.
