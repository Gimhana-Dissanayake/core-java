//Importance of main() method

//1.To manage application logic in java applications we need main() method. 

//2. To define starting point and ending point to the application execution we need main() method.

//Q) Is it mandatory to write main() in java appplications?

//Ans:

//Depending on the java version only, we are able to decide whether main() method is mandatory or not. Upto java6 version, main() method is optional, we can run java application even without using main() method and by using static variables, static methods, static blocks,...Right from Java7 version, main() method is mandatory, without main() method we are unable to execute java applications, because, from java7 version, jvm is able to load main class after getting confirmation of main() method in main class

//NOTE: in java applications, always, it is suggestible to prepare java application with main() method only, because, java has given a convention about to prepare java application like to use main() method
