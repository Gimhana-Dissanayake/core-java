//Q) what is the requirment to provide parameter to main() method?

//Ans:
//In java applications, we are able to provide input data in three ways

//1. static input:
//If we provide input data to the java program at the time of writing java application then that input data is called as Static input.

//2. Dynamic input:
//If we provide input data to the java applications at the time of executing java applications then that input data is called as Dynamic input

//3. Command line input/ command line arguments
//If we provide input data to the java applications by providing input data along with 'java' command on command prompt then that input data is called as command line input or command line arguments.

//If we provide command line input along with java command on command prompt then JVM will read that command line input, JVM will store that command line input in the form of String[] and JVM will pass that String[] as parameter to main() method at the time of accessing main() method.
