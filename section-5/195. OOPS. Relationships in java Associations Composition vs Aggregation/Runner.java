//In Java applications, Associations are represented in the form of the following two types

// 1. Composition
// 2. Aggregation

// Q. What are the differences between composition and aggregation

// 1. Composition is representing strong association between entities. Aggregation is representing weak association between entities

//2. In case of composition, if we close container then contained must be closed automatically. In case of Aggregation, even if we close container then contained may be existed.

// 3. In case of composition, contained lifetime is depending on container lifetime. In case of Aggregation, contained lifetime is not depending on container lifetime.
