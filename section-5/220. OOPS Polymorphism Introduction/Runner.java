    // The main advantage of polymorphism is "Flexibility"

    // There are two types of polymorphism in JAVA
    // 1. Static polymorphism. [Early Binding]
    // -If polymorphism is existed in compilation time it is Static polymorphism. Ex
    // -> Method overloading

    // 2. Dynamic polymorphism. [Late Binding]
    // -If polymorphism is existed in run time that is called Dynamic polymorphism
    // EX-> Method overriding
