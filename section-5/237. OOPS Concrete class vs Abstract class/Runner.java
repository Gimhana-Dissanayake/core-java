// 2. Concret classes are also called as 'completed classes'. Abstract classes are called as 'incompleted classes'

// 3. To declare concrete classes we are not going to use any special keyword.It is sufficient to use 'class 'keyword. To declare abstract classes we must use 'abstract' keyword along with 'class' keyword
