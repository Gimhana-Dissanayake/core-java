// Interface is a java feature, it able to allow only abstract methods.
// For interfaces, we are able to declare reference variables, we are unabled to create objects.
// Inside interfaces, bydefault, all variables are "public static final", not required to declare explicitly. public means we can acess that member through out the application. Static means we can access the member using interface name. final means we cannot change the variable once initialized
//Inside interfaces, bydefault, all methods are "public and abstract", not required to declare explicitly.
// In general, in java application, we are able to utilize interfaces to declare services without implemtaion and we will provide implmentation responsibility to some other module developer or some other third pary org.
