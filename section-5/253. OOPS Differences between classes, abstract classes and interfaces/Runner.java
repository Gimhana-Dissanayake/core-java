// Q. What are the differences between classes, abstract classes and interfaces

// 1. Classes are able to allow only concrete methods.
// Abstract classes are able to allow both concrete methods and abstract methods.
// Interface are able to allow only abstract methods

// 2. To declare classes, we will use 'class' keyword.
// To declare abstract classes we will use 'abstract' keyword along with class keyword.
// To declare interfaces we will use 'interface keyword'

// 3. For classes, we are able to provide both reference varialbes and objects
// for abstract classes and interfaces we are able to provide only reference variables, we are unable to create objects.

// 4. Inside the interfaces, by default, all avariable are "public static final", no need to decalre expilicly
// inside classes and abstract classes, no default cases are existed for varialbes.

// 5. Inside the interfces, bydefault, all methods are "public and abstract, not requried to decalre explicitly".
// Inside the classes and abstract classes, not default cases are exsiting for methods.

// 6. Inside interfaces, bydefault, all inner classes are static inner classes, not required to decalre explicitly. 
// Inside classes and abstract classes, not default cases are existed for inner classes.

// 7. Constructors are possible in classes and abstract classes.Constructors are not possible in interfaces.

// 8. Static blocks and interfcaces blocks are not possible in interfaces. Static blocks and Instance blocks are possible in classes and abstract classes

// 9. Static methods and instance methods are not possible in interfaces. Static methods and instance methods are possible in classes and abstract classes

// 10. Classes are able to provide less sharability. Abstract classes are able to provide middle level sharability. Interface are able to provide more sharability
