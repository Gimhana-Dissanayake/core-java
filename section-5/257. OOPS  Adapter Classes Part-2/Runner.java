// Adapter classes:

// Adapter class is a bridge between an interface and implementation classes, it cant be used to avoid the implementation for uncessary methods implmentation while implmenting interface implementation classes.

// EX: - In java.awt.event package, WindowListener interface contains 7 methods, out of all these 7 no of methods we need only one method in out application, because of only one method we are implmenting WindowListener interface and we are providing implementation for 6 no of methods unnecessarily, to avoid these unnecessary methods implmentation java.awt.event package has provided an adapter class that is WindowAdapter.

// Similarily, KeyLister has KeyAdapter class, MouseListner has MouseAdapter class

public class Runner {
