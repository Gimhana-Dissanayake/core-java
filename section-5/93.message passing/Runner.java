    // what is message passing?
    // If we transfer data along with flow of execution from one instruction to
    // anthoer instruction then it is called as Message passing.

    // In java applications, we are able to achieve message passing by calling
    // methods with parameters data and returning data from methods to methods call

    // the main advantage of message passing is to improve communication between
    // entitites and to improve data navigation between entitites.

    // Object oriented features and its basic advantage
    // class -----> Basic Element
    // object -----> Fundamental Element
    // Encapsulation -----> Security
    // Abstaction -----> Security
    // Inheritance -----> Code Reusability
    // Polymorphism -----> Flexibility
    // Message Passing -----> Data Navigation and Communication between Entities
