// Wrapper classes:

// Collection: Collection is an object, it able to represent or store a groupd of other objects

// Note: In Java, Collection objects are able to store only object reference values(located at heap), collection objects are not going to store primitive data directly. To do this we need wrapper classes.

// To convert the primitive type to object type and object type to primitive type we are going to use a set of pre defined classes these classes are called wrapper classes
